  <p>People of Hoboken today find it stressful when it comes to picking the right apartment to lease
    and live in. However, it is handy to be given a list of apartments that fit your criteria without
    having to go through many different websites to find the best fit. Therefore our project is focused
    on building a web application of user-submitted apartment evaluations so that other users can
    search and browse by apartment name, price, and ratings.</p>
